Atopic dermatitis (AD), is a common, complex and heterogeneous
inflammatory skin disease [1] . A large subset of patients develop AD by 5
years of age, which directly affects quality of life [2] , and increases risk for a
host of comorbidities, including asthma, allergic rhinitis, and food allergies [3] .
Filaggrin mutations, family history of atopy, and environmental factors are
important risk factors for AD development [1, 4] . Each provides poor predictive
value when used independently to stratify risk, yet a family history of atopy
has been used in the research setting [5, 6] and is the current standard of
care (SOC). A prognostic AD clinical risk score can empower clinicians to
diagnose AD earlier on or to educate caregivers on proven preventive
modalities for atopic conditions. It can also be employed by the clinical trialist
to enrich birth cohorts with a priori screening for at-risk patients. We aimed to
develop a clinical risk score using information available in the prenatal period,
with consideration to explainability and applicability, and validate it on an
external, geographically independent dataset.
The development dataset included the electronic medical records (EMR) of all
infant-mother dyads captured in the Leumit Health Services (Leumit) EMR
between 2010-2019 with a recorded AD diagnosis (ICD9=691 or 691.8)
before the age of three (n=7,370) and a random sample of infant-mother
dyads selected from the Leumit EMR whereby AD was not diagnosed in the
child&#39;s EMR (n=63,852). Leumit is one of four national health providers and its
EMR captures routine data from all medical consultations, procedures, and
prescriptions, along with relevant sociodemographic data. The US-based 3
Infant Feeding Practices Study 2 (IFPS2) was used as a validation dataset [7] .
The cohort included a nationally distributed panel of 1,807 infants born
between 2005-2007, of which 389 (21.5%) reported a doctor&#39;s diagnosis of
AD by the age of one.  <br>

All variables both identified in previous studies and present in the Leumit EMR
were included (sex, season of birth, household smoking, socioeconomic
status, urban/rural dwelling, presence of siblings, sibling history of AD and/or
an atopic condition, parental history of AD and/or an atopic condition and the
use of antibiotics during pregnancy). All were derived from the prenatal period
and grouped into three categories: demography (D), siblings (S), and parents
(P). A multivariate model which included all predictors was used to assess
each variable&#39;s independent contribution to risk, as measured by odds ratios,
which was then used to assign a score for each variable. All variables,
excluding summer birth and household smoking, were significant in the
multivariate model. Separate and independent multivariate models were used
to forecast the proportion of average predicted probability by each category,
as indicated by the models&#39; pseudo-R2 values, which was then used to weigh
the relative contribution of each group to the overall risk score (Figure 1A).
This information is used to tabulate a fetus&#39;s variable AD risk as follows:
((Wd*Demography Score + Ws*Siblings Score + Wp*Parent Score)/Max
Score)+C, where C is the underlying population prevalence of AD.  <br>

The scoring method is designed to generate a value from 0 to 1, representing
the probable risk in probabilistic terms, and can be effectively calculated if
some variables are missing. We divided the results into high (&gt;0.5), medium
(0.35-0.5) and low risk groups (&lt;0.35). The joint distribution of age at first AD
diagnosis and AD Score is depicted in Figure 1B. There was a significant
difference in means among the risk groups in relation to the actual cases of
atopic dermatitis (ANOVA, p&lt;0.001) for both train and validation set. When
compared to the SOC, individuals in the low-risk group were less likely to
develop AD than those without a parental history of atopy and individuals in
the high-risk group were more likely to develop AD than those with a parental
history of atopy for both train and validation set (Figure 1C). The OR in a
univariate logistic regression model for developing AD was 2.30 (CI 2.15-2.46,
p&lt;0.001) for the medium risk group and 4.06 (CI 3.80-4.34, p&lt;0.001) for the
high-risk group when compared with the low-risk group in the development
dataset. Separately, the OR for developing AD was 1.74 (CI 1.34-2.27,
p&lt;0.001) for the medium risk group and 3.36 (CI 2.51-4.49, p&lt;0.001) for the
high-risk group when compared with the low-risk group in the validation
dataset. These high-risk OR&#39;s are more than double the OR of the SOC
parental history of atopy calculated in the original multivariate model (OR
1.57, CI 1.43-1.72, p&lt;0.001) and demonstrate the utility of this method over
the current SOC.  <br>

This prognostic AD risk assessment model harnesses known environmental
and familial associations into a quantifiable and applicable clinical tool. It holds
the potential to inform clinicians and caregivers as to an infant&#39;s risk of
developing AD thereby influencing the continuum of care, enabling earlier
diagnosis, and targeting patients to adopt preventive measures for other
atopic conditions. Furthermore, it can reduce cohort sizes for AD-prevention
clinical trials. While developed on epidemiological data from an EMR, the
validation study showed its applicability on a geographically distinct survey-
based cohort, thereby opening the door to deployment in a variety of settings.
Future studies can further this approach by incorporating additional
documented risk factors and by exploring the utility of this approach for other
conditions associated with the atopic march.
